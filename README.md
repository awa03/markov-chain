# Byte Pair Encoding

This project was created in order to better understand compression algorithms as well as tokenization for llm implementations. 
This project will contain 3 parts, a byte pair encoder, a byte pair decoder, as well as a markov chain implemented using these byte pair encoding 
algorithms. This project seeks to prove the inherent intelligence stored within byte pair encoding, and how this application could be useful to improving 
AI models. 

This project will essentially be a proof of concept text completion without the use of AI.
